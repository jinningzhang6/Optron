Overview

Optron is a multi-sensory electronic music controller and visualizer, invented by Chet Udell. Optron can rapidly switch between using light as a visual effect and using it as a control input. This is designed for performing to audiences but more accessible for Deaf and Hard of hearing audiences.

Description

Optron can rapidly switch between using light as a visual effect and using it as a control input, when it is in visualization mode, sound and other performance status information are analyzed and translated into serial data and sent to the Optron render as colored light patterns. When paired with a webcam and computer visualization software, light position and color become the controller information, that can be wielded by waving hands over the lights or moving the Optron itself through space.
